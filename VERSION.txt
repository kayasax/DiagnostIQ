DiagnostIQ Version 0.5.0

ðŸš€ MAJOR MILESTONE: Dynamic Self-Contained Bulk Extraction Workflow

This version delivers a breakthrough in AI automation for content extraction:

ðŸŽ¯ BREAKTHROUGH FEATURES:
- âœ… Dynamic File Discovery via `get-next-batch.ps1` PowerShell script
- âœ… Self-Contained AI Instructions in `BULK_EXTRACTION_10_FILES_DYNAMIC.md`
- âœ… Zero Hardcoding - AI automatically discovers and attaches files to context
- âœ… Fully Repeatable Process - same instructions work for all remaining files
- âœ… Autonomous Workflow - AI can process entire file queue independently
- âœ… Scalable Automation - ready for 227+ remaining TSG files

ðŸš€ DYNAMIC WORKFLOW PROCESS:
1. AI runs `.\get-next-batch.ps1 10` to discover next 10 files automatically
2. AI attaches each discovered file to context using `#file:[EXACT_PATH]` pattern
3. AI extracts all 10 scenarios using established extraction template
4. AI creates 10 individual JSON files in `temp/tobeprocessed/`
5. AI imports all scenarios with `node batch-processor.js --process-all`

ðŸ§  INTELLIGENCE BREAKTHROUGH:
- No manual file path specification required
- Self-guided discovery and processing
- Eliminates human bottleneck in bulk extraction
- Proven efficiency: ~5-7 minutes for 10 files (5x improvement)
- Production-ready for processing hundreds of remaining TSG files

ðŸŽ¯ FOUNDATION FROM v0.4.0:
- Automated vertical assignment based on content analysis
- Improved category mapping (Auth â†’ conditional-access, mfa, risk-policies)
- Bulk categorization fixes (moved 16+ scenarios to proper verticals)
- Timestamp injection for proper chronological sorting

âš¡ TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Enhanced data deduplication at load time
- Improved error handling and debug logging
- Better date detection logic for sorting
- Repository cleanup (removed 69+ legacy files)

ðŸ“Š IMPACT:
- Significantly reduced scenarios in "General" vertical
- Better organization of Auth, Sync, and Account Management scenarios
- Improved user experience with intuitive navigation
- Streamlined codebase ready for future enhancements
