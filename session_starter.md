## üìò Project Overview
**Project Name:** DiagnosticIQ

**Description:** A comprehensive troubleshooting application designed for Azure AD/Entra ID support scenarios. More than just a query collection, it's a searchable library of troubleshooting cheat sheets that include cluster information, KQL queries, and step-by-step troubleshooting procedures. The app focuses on quick access, easy search, and efficient copy/paste workflows for support engineers.

**Primary Goals:**
- Create a fast, searchable interface for troubleshooting scenarios (e.g., Cross Tenant Sync)
- Support loading common query libraries from online sources (SharePoint, GitHub, etc.)
- Allow users to store and manage their own local query collections
- Provide comprehensive cheat sheets with cluster info, queries, and troubleshooting steps
- Implement syntax highlighting for KQL queries
- Optimize for usability: quick search, easy copy/paste, intuitive navigation

**Key Technologies / Tools:**
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Azure AD/Entra ID troubleshooting
- Data sources: Internal documentation, community knowledge base, local storage
- UI framework: Web-based for cross-platform support
