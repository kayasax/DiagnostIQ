## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
**Project Name:** DiagnosticIQ

**Description:** A comprehensive troubleshooting application designed for Azure AD/Entra ID support scenarios. More than just a query collection, it's a searchable library of troubleshooting cheat sheets that include cluster information, KQL queries, and step-by-step troubleshooting procedures. The app focuses on quick access, easy search, and efficient copy/paste workflows for support engineers.

**Primary Goals:**
- Create a fast, searchable interface for troubleshooting scenarios (e.g., Cross Tenant Sync)
- Support loading common query libraries from online sources (SharePoint, GitHub, etc.)
- Allow users to store and manage their own local query collections
- Provide comprehensive cheat sheets with cluster info, queries, and troubleshooting steps
- Implement syntax highlighting for KQL queries
- Optimize for usability: quick search, easy copy/paste, intuitive navigation

**Key Technologies / Tools:**
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Azure AD/Entra ID troubleshooting
- Source wiki: https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureAD/_wiki/wikis/AzureAD/183924/AAD
- Potential data sources: SharePoint, GitHub, local storage
- UI framework (TBD - likely web-based for cross-platform support)

## ðŸ§  Assistant Memory
This section is maintained by the AI assistant to track important context and decisions across sessions.

**Current Understanding:**
- âœ… **PROJECT COMPLETED**: DiagnosticIQ is a fully functional Azure AD troubleshooting query library
- âœ… **PUBLISHED**: Successfully published to GitHub as open-source project
- User works in Azure AD/Entra ID support and needed a specialized troubleshooting tool
- Primary use case is finding relevant queries and procedures for specific scenarios like Cross Tenant Sync
- Tool balances comprehensive sample library with local customization capabilities
- Focus is on support engineer workflow optimization - achieved through smart search, copy-paste, and categorization

**Known Constraints or Requirements:**
- âœ… KQL syntax highlighting implemented using Prism.js
- âœ… Both online (import/export) and local query storage supported
- âœ… Performance optimized - "quick and easy to use" achieved
- âœ… Copy/paste functionality implemented for all queries
- âœ… Professional UI with responsive design and accessibility features

**Pending Questions / Clarifications:**
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: Web app chosen as preferred technology stack
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: Local storage with import/export for content management
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: 7 comprehensive troubleshooting scenarios implemented
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: JSON-based data synchronization strategy implemented
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: Individual use with community sharing via GitHub

**Future Considerations:**
- GitHub Pages deployment for live hosting
- Advanced authentication for enterprise integration
- Real-time collaboration features
- API integration with Azure monitoring tools
