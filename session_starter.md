## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
**Project Name:** Azure AD Troubleshooting Query Library & Cheat Sheet App

**Description:** A comprehensive troubleshooting application designed for Azure AD/Entra ID support scenarios. More than just a query collection, it's a searchable library of troubleshooting cheat sheets that include cluster information, KQL queries, and step-by-step troubleshooting procedures. The app focuses on quick access, easy search, and efficient copy/paste workflows for support engineers.

**Primary Goals:**
- Create a fast, searchable interface for troubleshooting scenarios (e.g., Cross Tenant Sync)
- Support loading common query libraries from online sources (SharePoint, GitHub, etc.)
- Allow users to store and manage their own local query collections
- Provide comprehensive cheat sheets with cluster info, queries, and troubleshooting steps
- Implement syntax highlighting for KQL queries
- Optimize for usability: quick search, easy copy/paste, intuitive navigation

**Key Technologies / Tools:**
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Azure AD/Entra ID troubleshooting
- Source wiki: https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureAD/_wiki/wikis/AzureAD/183924/AAD
- Potential data sources: SharePoint, GitHub, local storage
- UI framework (TBD - likely web-based for cross-platform support)

## ðŸ§  Assistant Memory
This section is maintained by the AI assistant to track important context and decisions across sessions.

**Current Understanding:**
- User works in Azure AD/Entra ID support and needs a specialized troubleshooting tool
- Primary use case is finding relevant queries and procedures for specific scenarios like Cross Tenant Sync
- Existing knowledge base is in a wiki that should be leveraged
- Tool needs to balance online library access with local customization
- Focus is on support engineer workflow optimization

**Known Constraints or Requirements:**
- Must integrate with existing wiki content at specified URL
- Need syntax highlighting for KQL queries
- Must support both online and local query storage
- Performance is critical - "quick and easy to use"
- Copy/paste functionality is essential for support workflows

**Pending Questions / Clarifications:**
- Preferred technology stack for the application (web app, desktop app, VS Code extension?)
- Authentication requirements for accessing SharePoint/online sources
- Specific troubleshooting scenarios to prioritize beyond Cross Tenant Sync
- Data synchronization strategy between online and local content
- Team size and collaboration requirements
