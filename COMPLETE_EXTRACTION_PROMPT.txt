Extract troubleshooting scenarios from the Azure AD Cross-tenant sync documentation and convert them to JSON format for DiagnosticIQ.
TASK: Analyze the markdown file and extract ALL troubleshooting scenarios. Each scenario should represent a specific problem/solution pair.

RETURN ONLY a JSON array in this exact format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "test-connection-fails",
    "title": "Test Connection Fails in Cross-Tenant Sync",
    "description": "Connection test fails when configuring cross-tenant synchronization between Azure AD tenants",
    "category": "synchronization",
    "tags": ["cross-tenant", "sync", "connection", "azure-ad"],
    "cluster": "",
    "database": "",
    "steps": [
      "Verify target tenant ID in admin credentials (not the tenant you're currently signed into)",
      "Check cross-tenant access settings in both source and target tenants",
      "Ensure Application Service Principal exists in target tenant"
    ],
    "relatedKQL": [],
    "severity": "high",
    "source": "TSG-Cross-tenant-sync-(Azure2Azure-scenarios).md"
  }
]
```

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract ALL troubleshooting scenarios from the referenced file
2. Create unique IDs using kebab-case format
3. Use "synchronization" as the category for all scenarios
4. Include relevant tags for searchability
5. Format steps as an array of concise, action-oriented strings (not objects)
6. Each step should be a complete instruction including commands, queries, or actions
7. **CLUSTER & DATABASE**: Search the documentation for Kusto cluster and database information:
   - Look for URLs like "https://[clustername].kusto.windows.net" or Kusto cluster tables
   - Look for "Database Name:" or similar references
   - Common patterns: aadb2bprod.westus2.kusto.windows.net/aadb2b, idsharedwus.kusto.windows.net/AADSFprod
   - If no specific cluster/database found, use empty strings "" (blank values)
8. Assess severity: high for connection failures, medium for provisioning issues, low for informational
9. Include the source filename

EXTRACT ALL SCENARIOS AND RETURN ONLY THE JSON ARRAY, NO OTHER TEXT.
