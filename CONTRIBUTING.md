Thank you for your interest in contributing to DiagnosticIQ! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub Issues tab to report bugs or request features
- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates
- Provide clear, detailed descriptions
- Include steps to reproduce for bugs
- Tag issues appropriately (bug, enhancement, question, help wanted)

### Adding Troubleshooting Scenarios
We're always looking for more real-world Azure AD troubleshooting scenarios!

#### What Makes a Good Scenario:
1. **Common Support Cases**: Issues that support engineers frequently encounter
2. **Complete Information**:
   - Clear problem description
   - Multiple related KQL queries
   - Step-by-step troubleshooting procedures
   - Proper categorization and tags

3. **Production-Ready Queries**:
   - Tested KQL that works in Log Analytics
   - Proper time ranges and filters
   - Comments explaining query logic
   - Performance considerations

#### Format for New Scenarios:
```javascript
{
    id: unique_id,
    title: "Descriptive Title",
    category: "sync|auth|provisioning|performance|applications",
    cluster: "prod|staging|dogfood",
    description: "Clear description of the troubleshooting scenario",
    queries: [
        {
            name: "Query Name",
            description: "What this query does",
            query: `// KQL query with comments
            AuditLogs
            | where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
            // Add your KQL here`
        }
        // Add more queries as needed
    ],
    steps: [
        "Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions",
        "Each step should be actionable",
        "Reference the queries above when relevant"
    ],
    tags: ["relevant", "tags", "for", "searching"]
}
```
